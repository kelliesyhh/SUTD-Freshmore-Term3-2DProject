# SUTD Term 3 - Freshmore
# 2D Project

## Overview
The Design Thinking Project III is a project across three subjects, and this project is being led by the elective 10.020 Data Driven World. In this project, students are expected to cohesively apply knowledge learnt in 10.020 Data Driven World, 10.022 Modelling Uncertainty, and 2.001 Global Humanities.

In this project, students are given a specific context to a problem to design (discover, define, develop and delivery phases, from the UK Design Council Double Diamond) an open-ended solution by applying know-how, design skills and methods.

## Tasks
The World Health Organization (WHO) is interested in projecting the death rate of COVID-19 in various countries so that they are able to coordinate help and support to countries affected by COVID-19. Different countries have different health care systems, population densities, and national policies in combating COVID-19. You are to help WHO to make a model to predict the number of deaths based on known data of each particular country. One of the challenges is to find some appropriate predictor variables for the model.

### Task 1
Build a Multiple Linear Regression model that predicts the number of deaths in various countries due to COVID-19. You are free to select and choose the dataset you would like to use while building the model and are allowed to use the Pandas Library in your code and can use Excel.
The following technical/tool constraint applies: you are NOT allowed to use any existing machine learning packages, such as scikit-learn.
As a general guide, you may need to undertake the following actions:
* Find data sets for the number of deaths in various countries (a minimum of 20 countries) due to COVID-19.
* Research for appropriate predictor variables to predict deaths due to COVID-19.
* You may use time as one of the predictors (in which case you could attempt to predict death rates in the future), or you may choose to leave it out (in which case, you would be looking at the deaths at a fixed chosen point in time).
* Find data sets on the chosen predictors for the various countries in the model.
* Use plots to visualize and understand your data.
* Build a model and test the accuracy of your model, using an appropriately chosen metric (hint: r2 is not a good metric for this task).
* If needed, improve your model by incorporating other predictors, and/or removing
existing ones.
* Discuss your data sets, model, accuracy, and what metrics you used to judge the accuracy.

### Task 2
You are free to find and define a problem (apply the discovery and define phases first, from the UK Design Council Double Diamond, 3.007 Design Thinking and Innovation) of your interest related to COVID-19. The problem can be modelled either using Linear Regression (or Multiple Linear Regression) or Logistic Regression, which means you can work with either continuous numerical data or classification.
The following technical/tool constraint applies: you are NOT allowed to use Neural Networks or other Machine Learning models. You must use Python and Jupyter Notebook.
In general, you may want to consider performing the following steps:
* Find an interesting problem which you want to solve either using Linear Regression or Classification (please check with your instructors first on whether the problem makes sense).
* Find a dataset to build your model. For example, you can use Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find suitable datasets.
* Use plots to visualize and understand your data. 
* Create training and test data sets.
* Build your model.
* Choose an appropriate metric to evaluate your model (you may use the same metric as the one used in Task 1).
* Improve your model.

### Task 3
Analyse and compare how different political philosophies and ideologies influence COVID-19 national policies in different countries. Furthermore, design your own COVID-19 national policy that advances the ideals of equality and justice (as defined by you on class readings and discussions).
