COVID-19 Vaccination Policy Categories
Reason for suitability: No. of vaccines available will result in how many people can possibly be vaccinated. If lesser people can be vaccinated, more people would be infected resulting in higher no. of cases
Meaning of data values:
0 = No availability of vaccines
1 = Availability for ONE of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups
2 = Availability for TWO of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups
3 = Availability for ALL of following: key workers/ clinically vulnerable groups / elderly groups
4 = Availability for all three plus partial additional availability (select broad groups/ages)
5 = Universal availability
Ultimate relationship of data values to no. of cases: Higher data value, lower no. of cases

Stay at home requirements/Household Lockdown
Reason for suitability: Lesser stay home requirements/household lockdown can lead to higher no. of interactions in public spaces. This can result in higher transmission rates of COVID-19, hence increasing the no. of cases
Meaning of data values:
0 = No measures
1 = Recommended not to leave the house
2 = Required to not laeve the house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and 'essential' trips
3 = Required to not leave the house with minimal exceptions (e.g. allowed to leave only once every few days, or only one person can leave at a time, etc.)
Ultimate relationship of data values to no. of cases: Higher data value, lower no. of cases

Public Gathering Rules
Reason for suitability: Larger gathering groups will result in higher transmission rates and hence resulting in higher no. of cases
Meaning of data values:
0 = No restrictions
1 = Restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people)
2 = Restrictions on gatherings between 100 to 1000 people
3 = Restrictions on gatherings between 10 to 100 people
4 = Restrictions on gatherings of less than 10 people
Ultimate relationship of data values to no. of cases: Higher data value, lower no. of cases

COVID-19 Testing Policies (ONLY PCR Test)
Reason for suitability: If the government policy is less stringent on who can take the PCR Test, more people are able to test for 
Meaning of data values:
0 = No testing policy
1 = Testing only for those who both (a) have symptoms AND (b) meet specific criteria (e.g. key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas)
2 = Testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms
3 = Open public testing (e.g “drive through” testing available to asymptomatic people)
Ultimate relationship of data values to no. of cases: Higher data value, lower no. of cases

Government Policies on the use of face coverings outside of home.
Reason for suitability: If the policy requires masks to be worn in more scenarios, there will be lower transmission rates as masks are worn more often, thus there will be lower no. of cases
Meaning of data value:
0 = No Policy
1 = Recommended
2 = Required in some specified shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present, or some situations when social distancing not possible
3 = Required in all shared/public spaces outside the home with other people present or all situations when social distancing not possible
4 = Required outside the home at all times regardless of location or presence of other people
Ultimate relationship of data values to no. of cases: Higher data value, lower no. of cases
